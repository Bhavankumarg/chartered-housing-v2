                has played a significant role in shaping the real estate sector
                through his long-standing association with CREDAI. He is the
                Past President of CREDAI Karnataka and currently serves as the
                Chairman of the CREDAI National Centre of Learning, which

                Institute of Management – Bangalore for CREDAI members across
                the country. He has also contributed to the industry’s thought
                leadership as the former Editor of CREDAI Times, the in-house

                He further expanded CREDAI’s reach by inducting new city
                associations in Hubli & Dharwad, Mysore, Mangalore, and
                Udupi—bringing regional representation to the fore for the first
                time in 27 years. This expansion laid the groundwork for a more
                inclusive and collaborative industry body across Karnataka.
